## 📌 1. Repository Overview

### 🔹 What is this repository?
This repository is a **collection of independent projects**, each stored in its own folder.  
Every folder represents **one learning idea, mini-project, or practical implementation**.

Instead of creating many small repositories, everything is kept in **one organized place** so you can:
- Track your learning journey
- Compare beginner → advanced projects
- Revisit older concepts easily
- Showcase growth over time

### 🔹 Why multiple projects in one repository?
- Easier for beginners to manage
- One place to explore many topics
- Shows learning progression clearly
- Useful as a **personal portfolio + notebook**

### 🔹 Who is this repository for?
This repository is ideal for:
- 🎓 Students
- 🧑‍💻 Beginners learning programming
- 🤖 ML & automation learners
- 🔧 Hardware & microcontroller enthusiasts
- 📚 Self-learners building strong fundamentals
- 🧠 Engineers revising concepts through projects
